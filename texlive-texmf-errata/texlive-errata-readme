texlive errata

Due to the size of the texlive-texmf package, a small fix to a package in the
TEXMF tree would result in large updates for the users.

For this reason, the texlive errata package exists.

Updates to the texlive TEXMF packages can be issued in the errata package,
which will install them into /usr/share/texmf-errata.

This should avoid large downloads being necessary for small bug fixes.
